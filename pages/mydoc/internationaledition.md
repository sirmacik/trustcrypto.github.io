## What is the International Travel Edition?

This version of OnlyKey firmware is designed to meet all international requirements in regards to encryption. It does this by not utilizing encryption at all. Because this version does not encrypt any data on device it can be used in areas where data encryption is forbidden and/or there are mandatory key disclosure requirements. This is particularly useful for international travel where the traveler would like to have secure portable access to accounts.

## How are accounts secure without encryption?

Even though data is not encrypted, there is physical security of the accounts on the OnlyKey. This is accomplished through locking the flash memory and requiring a PIN code to access accounts. The accounts stored on the device can only be accessed with the correct PIN. Entering 10 incorrect PINs will completely wipe the device. Unlike a device like a flash/jump drive, the OnlyKey is locked so that there is no way of reading the data stored on the device.

## Limited features

The International Travel Edition has a limited feature set, including:

- Storage of 12 slots, each slot may contain:
  - Label - A reminder of what account is stored
  - URL - The site to log into may be automatically typed in the browser address bar
  - Username

  - 2FA - Google Authenticator OTP (TOTP) is supported

- Firmware loading through the app - You can switch back and forth from the International Travel Edition and Standard edition firmware through the OnlyKey app.

## Switch to Standard Edition Firmware

It is easy to switch between the International Travel Edition firmware and the Standard Edition firmware.

{% include tip.html content="***Factory Default?***<br><br>
To perform a factory default you have two options:
<br>
<br>
**Method #1** - Enter your self-destruct PIN.
<br>
<br>
**Method #2** - Enter 10 incorrect PINs. You will notice that after entering 3 incorrect PINs your OnlyKey is steadily blinking red. This is an intentional safeguard so that your OnlyKey will not be inadvertently wiped by repeatedly pressing buttons. You must remove and reinsert your OnlyKey and enter 3 more incorrect PINs. Repeat this until 10 incorrect PINs have been entered. The device will then have a solid green light on that indicates that it is in a factory default state." %}

### Set Wipe Mode

The wipe mode setting determines what is wiped when a factory default occurs. The default setting is to just wipe the sensitive data, there is also the option to do a "Full Wipe" which wipes sensitive data and firmware. If keeping the type and version of firmware that is loaded confidential is desired, go to preferences in the OnlyKey app and set the wipe mode of your OnlyKey to "Full Wipe". More information on this setting is available here - [Wipe Mode Feature](https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#configurable-wipe-mode).
